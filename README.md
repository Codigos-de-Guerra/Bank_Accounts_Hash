# Hash Implementation for Bank Accounts. A project for Estrutura de Dados BÃ¡sicas I (EDB I)

## Introduction

This programming project implements a hash for Bank Account Management. Through information received via client, we shall be able to manage each and every account, supporting basic operations such as *inserting, consulting and removing*. Through Hashing, we will associate each account info to a created key. Since it is possibly to have the same account number for different agencies, we can't work with a key that receives only these 2 informations. For pratical use, we are considering a key to be a group of the *client's name, bank code, agency number* and *bank accounts number* data.

## How to compile

First of all, obviously this repository is needed to work as desired, so we must to download this repo. As we know that ```git``` is a tremendous tool for any programmer, then we must have git installed.

It is also expected for user to have installed [doxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen) program. This will automatically generate documentation for code. Not a necessary package to compile and run program, but it is a tool to guide user through code functions. To install `doxygen` on UBUNTU, for example:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install doxygen
```
To compile we will use a makefile, so compilations may be more dynamic and automatic.
```bash
# Using 'git clone' to clone this repo into desired directory:
$ git clone https://github.com/Codigos-de-Guerra/Bank_Accounts_Hash.git

# Enter repo:
$ cd Bank_Accounts_Hash

# To compile the whole project and also generate documentation, insert 'make' inside root of path:
$ make

# To clean up all remaining trash data and files, such as the binary ones, insert 'make clean':
$ make clean
```

## How to execute

Now, we show how to run the program. 
```bash
# To execute program:
$ ./bank
```
### Example

It really is that simple. Since we aren't testing with actual bank accounts data or similars, we just need to check if it really works, and if is ready for pratical uses. Therefore, a simple execution is used.
```bash
$ ./bank
```
